    "    You are presented with three closed doors. A car is behind one, and goats are behind the other two. \n",

    "    doors (e.g., Door 3) to reveal a goat. The host then asks if you want to stick with your original \n",

    "\n",
    "    Create simulations where you test both strategies: staying with your original guess or switching \n",
    "    to the other door. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For instance: suppose you choose door 1 (and door 1 happens to have the car behind it).  Monty reveals either \n",
    "    door 2 or door 3 (assume he selects one with equal probabilities).  In the no switching simulation you keep door 1 \n",
    "    and win the car. In the switching strategy you pick the door he doesn't show (2 or 3) and get the goat. \n",

    "    In another example you pick door 1, the car is behind door 2, Monty must reveal door 3 to show you a goat.\n",
